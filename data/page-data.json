      "answer": "Yes, the roof of a building is one of a its greatest assets. After all it protects the user's stock, machinery, employees, etc. New builds can be very costly to a company, and thus the correct maintenance programmes need to be implemented in order to avoid complete replacement. By implementing the correct maintenance programmes for the right building, the life span of that building can be vastly increased."

      "id": "question2",
      "answer": "The cost to replace a roofing system is generally a very expensive project. In many cases a full replacement is not necessary. There are numerous cost saving options when looking to not only resolve roof leaks but also refurbish an existing building. These options can be tailor made to the client/tenants needs"

      "id": "question3",
      "answer": "Yes, there are several green, energy reducing options that can be considered when refurbishing an existing warehouse/building. For example, by maximising the natural lighting, insulation and natural ventilation you can vastly decrease your carbon footprint on the earth. A lower carbon footprint also reduces expenses on air conditioning and lighting costs. Therefore, in the long run, being green also means saving money."

      "question": "What is the benefit to having insulation installed in my building?",
      "url": "/faqs#question4",
      "id": "question4",
      "answer": "Insulation offers your building reduced heat transfer through sheeting, thereby minimising energy consumption on air-conditioning/cooling. Insulation can help create the ideal ambient temperature inside the building, being cooler in summer, or warmer in winter."

      "answer": "We offer guarantees to suit our clients. This is provided they enter maintenance schedules that we recommend for their buildings. Depending on the location and atmosphere the building is subjected to, will determine how extensive the maintenance plans may be. Without the correct maintenance these guarantees may be limited and the lifespan of a system will shorten exponentially."
